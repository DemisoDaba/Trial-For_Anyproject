## The order by which we are trying:
* Step-1: Started by creating a char function plus every format of the char function have a specic use.
* Step-2: The created function will skip '%' and go for the other function format tp run.
* Step-3: We added each and every prototype to *main.h* header.
* Step-4: We tried to merge all function in *_printf*.
* We are tried to handle the following conversion specifiers: "%c" "%s" "%" "%d" "i".

## The pseudocode :pencil:
